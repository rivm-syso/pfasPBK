# Introduction

This repository showcases the conversion of a readily available PFOA PBK model to the Antimony programming language. The main goal of converting the R-code into Antimony is to facilitate the subsequent conversion to the SBML file format, which is chosen as the file format of choice for the implementation of PBK models.

The PFOA and PFOS PBK models implemented in this repository were originally developed by [Loccisano et al.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0273230010002242?via%3Dihub]) and subsequently modified by [Westerhout et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfae006).
